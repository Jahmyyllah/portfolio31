	<p class="message">" &nbsp Thank you for our ICT teacher, Sir Cimafranca, for teaching us on how to code and create HTML, CSS, and more. Even though this school year has come to an end, I had wonderful experiences in school, especially the ICT subject. Despite having difficulties on some parts of the coding, I still completed it and sometimes even solved it with the help of our ICT teacher's guidance and tips. This will be my final project, combining almost every lessons that was taught to us to this Personal Portfolio Website. &nbsp "</p>
